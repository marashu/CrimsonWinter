CrimsonWinter
=============

Crimson Winter was a Facebook game that was live from 2011 to mid 2012.  At its height, it had a community of roughly 200 players.  The game featured missions, which the player could achieve alone, duels, which allowed players to compete directly with friends or other players, and wars, which had players contributing strength towards a daily team battle event.  Players could also send gifts to friends.  Late 2011 saw an update to the game, with a new area for high level players, and boss battles which encouraged players to request help from their friends.

The game was largely programmed with php and html.  Some javascript was used for functions like timers counting down when players would recover health and energy, and some AJAX was used for sending gifts to other players.  The database was accessed using mysql commands in php, and was maintained using phpMyAdmin.

Certain files, like the variables to connect to the database and the variables containing the facebook app secret, are not included in this repository.
